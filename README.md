# Nugget-Software-Language

Nugget Software Language(NSL) is my programing language that I made with ChatGPT(because that is to hard without AI or any help) in Python.
I made it to be powerful but BASIC-like. It's fun to make it. Language is now avalibe as binaries for Windows or Linux, but there are not MacOS version.
I also place source code to you can compile it with Pyinstaller if you on MacOS or other OS.
Documentation are avalibe in Docs folder. I place docs in PDF, Word and Markdown and you can select wath format is best for you.

Thanks for visitng Nugget Software Language Page!
